# Multiple-Year-Stock-Data-VBA

For this project I used VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. 
*Data Source: * [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx]

![stock Market](Images/stockmarket.jpg)

Using VBA I created a script that looped through each year of stock data accomplished the following: 
*Grabbed the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
* Displayed ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.
* Calculated early change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was 
* Determined percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
* The total Volume of the stock
* Wrote conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
* Located the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.
